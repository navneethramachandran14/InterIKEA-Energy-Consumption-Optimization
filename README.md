# Energy Consumption Optimization

This project demonstrates energy consumption optimization using Microsoft Azure and Databricks, with a focus on sustainability.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Azure** (Blob Storage, Databricks)
- **Python** (with PySpark)
- **Spark** (for data processing)

## Project Overview
The project leverages data engineering skills to upload energy consumption data to Azure Blob Storage, process the data using Databricks, and build a linear regression model for energy consumption prediction.

## Files in the Repository
- **`databricks-notebooks/energy_consumption_optimization.ipynb`**: Databricks notebook with the energy consumption optimization logic.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts used for data upload, transformation, and modeling in Azure.
- **`dataset/ikea_energy_consumption.csv`**: Sample energy consumption data.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies required for the project.
